Home grown recipes for AutoPkg and Munki

Notes:
- 20190902: Serif's version naming conventions was "unified" with version 1.7.2 of their software packages (same version for Designer, Photo and Publisher). The recipes here are incompatible with their older versioning conventions.
- 20210520: The Sony Imaging Edge Desktop recipe installs the Edit, Remote and Viewer apps directly. The "launcher app" is neither included nor fuctionally necessary.
